## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions! This is a multiplayer game with complex real-time synchronization, so please follow these guidelines:

### Development Workflow

1. **Fork and Clone**: Fork the repository and create a feature branch
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Code Standards**:
   - Use TypeScript for all new code
   - Follow existing naming conventions
   - Add proper TypeScript types for multiplayer messages
   - Test multiplayer functionality with multiple browser tabs/windows

3. **Multiplayer Considerations**:
   - **State Synchronization**: All game state changes must be broadcast to other players
   - **Authority**: The host player has authority over certain game events
   - **Interpolation**: Player movements should be interpolated for smooth rendering
   - **Conflict Resolution**: Handle cases where multiple players interact with the same object

4. **Testing Multiplayer Features**:
   - Open multiple browser tabs to simulate different players
   - Test room creation, joining, and leaving
   - Verify state synchronization across all clients
   - Test edge cases like network disconnections

### Adding New Features

#### New Game Objects
- Add 3D models to `public/models/`
- Create React components in `game/components/`
- Implement multiplayer synchronization in `party/game.ts`
- Update TypeScript types in `game/multiplayer/types.ts`

#### New Levels
- Create level components in `game/components/`
- Add level-specific logic to the PartyKit server
- Update level selection UI
- Ensure proper state reset when changing levels

#### Character Variants
- Add new 3D models to `public/models/`
- Update character selection UI
- Add variant to TypeScript types
- Ensure proper network synchronization

### Code Review Process

1. **Create Pull Request**: Push your feature branch and create a PR
2. **Description**: Include detailed description of changes and multiplayer implications
3. **Testing**: Describe how you tested multiplayer functionality
4. **Review**: At least one maintainer must review and approve

### Key Multiplayer Concepts

- **Room Codes**: 4-character alphanumeric codes for joining games
- **Host Authority**: First player in room becomes host, controls game start
- **State Broadcasting**: All game state changes are sent to PartyKit server
- **Interpolation**: Client-side prediction and interpolation for smooth movement
- **Conflict Prevention**: Server validates and prevents invalid state changes

## 📦 Deployment

### PartyKit Server
```bash
npm run deploy:party
```

### Frontend
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## 🔧 Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start React development server
- `npm run dev:party` - Start PartyKit development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run deploy:party` - Deploy PartyKit server

## 🎯 Game Mechanics

### Core Gameplay
- **Movement**: WASD or arrow keys
- **Interaction**: Spacebar for actions (attacking, interacting)
- **Objectives**: Collect gems, pop balloons, complete levels

### Multiplayer Rules
- Maximum 4 players per room
- Host controls game start
- All players share the same world state
- Competitive and cooperative elements
